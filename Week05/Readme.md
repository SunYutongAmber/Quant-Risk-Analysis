This is project 4 for Week05. 

For the first problem, we use the data called problem1.csv, and fit a normal distribution and a generalized T distribution to the data respectively. The VaR and Expected Shortfalls (ES) are calculated for each fitted distribution.
And we draw the results in the same graph and observe the pattern.
