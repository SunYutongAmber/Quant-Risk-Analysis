This is project 4 for Week05. 

For the first problem, we use the data called problem1.csv, and fit a normal distribution and a generalized T distribution to the data respectively. The VaR and Expected Shortfalls (ES) are calculated for each fitted distribution.
And we draw the results in the same graph and observe the pattern.

For Problem 2, we first generate the code for each simulation or calculation and then generate a suitcase to test the code.

And for problem 3, using Portfolio.csv and DailyPrices.csv and assuming the expected return on all stocks is 0. We fit a Generalized T model to each stock and calculate the VaR and ES of each portfolio as well as the
total VaR and ES. Finally, we compare the results from this to your VaR form Problem 3 from Week 4.
