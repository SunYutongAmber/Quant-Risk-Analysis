Here is the project for this week:

For problem 1, we have calculated the time to maturity using calendar days. For a range of implied volatilities between 10% and 80%, we ploted the value of the call and the put. And we discussed how does the supply and demand affect the implied volatility.

For problem 2, using the given APLL data, we drew the graph of the implied volatility for the call and put option with different strike price and discussed the shape of these graphs.

For problem 3, using the portfolios found in problem3.csv, and for each of the portfolios, we graphed the portfolio value over a range of underlying values. Plot the portfolio values and discuss the shapes. Using DailyPrices.csv. Calculate the log returns of AAPL. Demean the series so there is 0 mean. Fit an AR(1) model to AAPL returns. Simulate AAPL returns 10 days ahead and apply those returns to the current AAPL price (above). Calculate Mean, VaR and ES.
